    <Extended description>
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    lowestRank : int
        The lowest card rank in the deck played. Changing this
        will impact the maximum number of players allowed in the
        game, since the more cards are there in the deck, the
        more hands can be dealt. With the lowest rank of 6 (the
        default), the number of players admitted is 5.
    loserDefends : bool
        Whether or not the loser (fool) is the first defendant
        of the new game. Default is ``False``, meaning that the
        the first attacker in a new game seats on the loser's
        left.
    cardsPerHand : int
        The least number of cards that each player shall have on
        hand at the beginning of a turn until the talon is exhausted.
    playerFactory : function
        This and other parameters listed below are passed
        directly to the superclass and should follow its
        specifications.

    Attributes
    -----------------
    attacker : int | None
        Index of the first attacking player for the pending current turn
        or None if the attacking player has not yet been determined.
    defendant : int | None
        Index of the defending player for the pending or current turn
        or None if the defending player has not yet been determined.
    result : (int, int) | None
        A tuple with the last game winner's and loser's indexes, or
        ``None`` if no game had started yet or the last game was a tie.
        If there is a game in progress (see `playing`), the value of this
        property is unspecified.
    gamesPlayed : int
        The number of games played thus far.
    deckFactory : cards.DeckFactory
        An object that generates decks for this game.
    trumpCard : cards.CardFace
        The card at the bottom of stock that shows the trump suit.
    stockCount : int
        The number of cards remaining in stock, including the trump
        card.
    stats : collections.Sequence
        A sequence that accumulates win and loss counts by players
        in prior games. Elements are tuples with win and loss counts,
        in that order, for each player's seat.
    rankKeys : collections.Mapping
        Maps known card ranks to integer values for ordering
        within a suit. Jokers do not have a rank.
