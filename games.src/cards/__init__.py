    Modules that model items and actions involved in card games.
    
    The package module defines classes that implement playing cards
    and basic operations with them.

    Key elements
    ------------
    CardFace : A class that describes a playing card by its rank
    and suit.
    DeckFactory : A protocol for classes that create decks of
    cards.
    SimpleDeckFactory : Creates decks of standard (French) playing
    cards.
    Dealer : Shuffles and deals decks of cards.
    game : A module that provides skeletal classes to help model
    card games.
    durak : A module that models the Durak game.
    ... TODO: other modules, if any

class CardFace(collections.Hashable, comety.JSONSerializable):
    """
    Describes a playing card by its rank and suit.
    
    Objects of this class contain immutable rank and suit
    information about a playing card. In addition, they provide
    equality and hashing operations for use of cards in data
    structures.
    
    Parameters
    --------------------
    rankSuitOrCode : str | (object, str)
        Specifies the identity of a card to create. The argument
        is either a string of the form '<rank-code><suit-code>'
        that identifies the new card; or a number or full name of
        a rank, and a full name of a suit.  

    Attributes
    -----------------
    code
    ranks
    suits
    rank : str
        A string from the set of `ranks` keys identifying the
        card's rank. 
    suit : str | None
        A string from the set of `suits` keys identifying the
        card's suit. For a joker (as determined by an `isJoker()`
        call, this may be a None, since jokers don't have a suit.
        Other cards are required to have a string value here. 

    Methods
    ---------------
    ranks_()
        Override this method in a subclass to define custom ranks for your
        cards.
    suits_()
        Override this method in a subclass to define custom suits for your
        cards.
    isJoker()
        Tell whether this card is a joker.

    Raises
    ----------
    TypeError
        If the constructor encounters invalid number or type of
        argument(s).
    ValueError
        If the constructor encounters invalid rank, suite, or code
        argument(s).

        Deal hands from a collection of objects (deck of cards).
        
        Deals cards from a deck sequentially to a specified number of hands.
        Each hand receives a batch of cards at a time, then dealer deals to
        the next hand, and so on until the specified number of cards is dealt
        to each hand. Remaining cards are placed in the stock, which may
        begin or end at a specific offset in the initial deck.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        deck : collections.Sequence
            A sequence of objects (such as cards) to be dealt.
            If `deck` is a `collections.MutableSequence`, all objects will
            be removed from it on success, otherwise the sequence will be
            copied into a new list before dealing.
        handCount : int
            The number of hands to be dealt, must be positive.
        cardsPerHand : int
            The number of cards to be dealt to each hand, must be positive.
        cardsPerBatch : int, optional
            The number of cards in a batch dealt to one hand before
            switching to the next one. Defaults to one.
        stockOffset : int, optional
            Offset of the stock of undealt cards (aka. talon, widow, skat,
            etc.) in the initial deck. This may be a positive number to locate
            the stock's first card relative to the beginning of the deck, or
            a negative number to point at the stock's **last card** relative
            to the end of the deck. Default value of -1 means that the stock's
            last card is the last card of the initial deck. The offset must
            be chosen to accommodate for the entire stock within the deck
            without rolling over its edges.
    
        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            Contains the stock at index 0 and the hands dealt at indexes
            equal to their numbers. Both stock and the hands are returned
            as lists.
    
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the cards cannot be dealt according to supplied parameters.
        TypeError
            If the deck object does not have a supported type.
