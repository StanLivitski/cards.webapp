    Abstract base class for card games.
    
    TODO: Extended description
    
    The constructor takes as arguments settings, such as number of
    players, rule tweaks, scoring conventions, etc. Names and exact
    meanings of those settings depend on the concrete game. The game
    implementation should also provide defaults for settings that it
    does not receive explicitly. Settings that apply to the base
    class, and their default meanings, are listed below. To override
    a setting, supply a respective named parameter to the constructor.
    The constructor also takes care of creating actual `Player` objects
    if they are not supplied by a caller. See description of the
    `playerFactory` parameter below for details. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    playerFactory : function
        A function that generates player objects for this game.
        This function will be called with parameters (game, seat),
        where seat is the player's seat number starting from 0
        to 1 less than the `players` setting. If the `players` setting
        supplies all player objects to this game, this argument is ignored
        and may be omitted. As an alternative to supplying this function,
        you may override the `createPlayer` method in a subclass.
    players : int | collections.Iterable
        The number of players in this game or a source of new
        `Player` objects to be attached to it. When this value is a
        number, or any of the values it yields is `None`, the
        `playerFactory` parameter or `createPlayer` method
        is used to obtain any missing players for the game. Otherwise,
        the players are obtained from the iterator. The
        default initial value of this setting is number 2.

    Attributes
    ----------
    settings : mapping.ImmutableMap
        Effective values of this game's settings supplied via its
        constructor or `defaults`().
    players : collections.Sequence
        A list of players in this game.
    [ # or # <name_of_a_property_having_its_own_docstring>
    ...]

    Methods
    ---------------
    defaults()
        Override to return default settings for a game.
    start()
        Override to set up initial state of a game within this object.
    settingAccessor(callable)
        Decorator of a callable that fetches or computes values based on
        a game's `settings`. The callable should take a mapping with settings
        as its sole argument. The result is a method that substitutes the value
        of the `Game.settings` attribute to the wrapped callable for that
        argument when its value is a `Game` instance.
[    <name>([<param>, ...])
        <One-line description of a method to be emphasized among many others.>
]

    Raises
    ----------
    TypeError
        if any `players` objects or an object created by `playerFactory`
        callback or `createPlayer` method is not of the `Player` type.
    ValueError
        if iterator over `players` setting returns no elements
