@receiver(ViewWithEvents.USER_TIMEOUT_SIGNAL)
def expireSession(sender, **kwargs):
    """
    Receive a session expiration signal and dispatch it
    to the appropriate model based on the arguments.
    
    This callback receives `ViewWithEvents.USER_TIMEOUT_SIGNAL`
    signals, locates the appropriate model for the sending view,
    and dispatches the signal to the target model. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    sender : type
        The class of an object that send this event (usually,
        a view).
    
    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Explicitly returns ``False`` to enable the sender to
        de-register the expired user.

    Other parameters
    ----------
    cometyDispatcher : comety.Dispatcher
        Comety dispatcher that encountered the timeout.
        Use this reference to identify the scope of `userId`
        belonging to the expired session's user.
    userId : collections.Hashable
        Identity of the user that had her session expired.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``sender`` is of an unknown type, which prevents this
        method from dispatching the signal correctly.
