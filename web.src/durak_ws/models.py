class InboundAddressEnumerator(collections.Sequence):
    """
    Contains list of names and addresses that can be used
    to connect to this host by other network devices and provides
    some additional network address information. 
    
    This class follows the singleton pattern, which means you don't
    create any instances thereof. This module will create the only 
    object of this class and store it in the `FACILITY` class variable.
    Use that instance to determine this host's external names and
    addresses on the network. The results are represented as a
    read-only sequence of ``(label, family, address)`` tuples,
    where:
    
    - ``label`` is the human-readable label of the item
    - ``family`` is either an ``AF_*`` constant from the
      `socket` module if the item contains an address, or
      ``None`` if the item contains a network name
    - ``address`` is either a network name or an address
      in its family-specific string format

    The `FACILITY` sequence is guaranteed to have at least one element:
    this host's name returned by `socket.gethostname`(). If
    `socket.fqdn`() reports a different value, it will be added
    to the sequence as well.

    Additionally, this class has static methods that provide
    network address information. Those methods are summarized
    below.

    Methods
    ---------------
    resolve(nameOrAddress, type_):
        Resolve a host name into network addresses(es) or convert
        addresses(es) to the canonical format
    isLoopbackAddress(family, address, strict):
        Tell whether a network address belongs to a loopback device.

    Raises
    ----------
    RuntimeError
        When an attempt is made to create an additional instance of this
        type.

    Notes
    ----------
    This class uses the `netifaces <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces/>`
    library to determine the host's external addresses in a way that works
    across platforms. ``netifaces`` does not declare the native symbols it
    exports in the Python code, which causes ``Undefined variable from import``
    warnings in the code below. These warnings may be ignored until
    ``netifaces`` is fixed to declare its sybmols properly.

    Examples
    ----------------
    >>> enum = InboundAddressEnumerator.FACILITY
    >>> len(enum) > 0
    True
    >>> all( type(a) is tuple for a in enum )

    Admits players into this web application and sets up a new game.
    
    Use an object of this class to record names and session tokens
    of players who will be joining a game. Once all seats are taken,
    the object can be used to generate a dictionary of parameters to
    be passed to the new game constructor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gameType : type, optional
        A concrete class that implements the game to be played.
        This must be a subclass of `cards.game.Game` with a constructor
        having the same signature. Defaults to `WebGame` if omitted.

    game
    id
    host
    playerStata
    ready
    port
    tokens
    uiDispatcher
    chatDispatcher : comety.Dispatcher
        Comety dispatcher for sending chat messages between players.
        Players registered with the dispatcher using their tokens, when
        such tokens are created, and never unregistered, so messages from
        a player who left may still be delivered.
    FACILITIES : collections.Mapping
        A class variable containing player ids mapped to objects of this
        type used to set up games for those players. Since a game id is
        equal to one of its' players ids (see `getId`), this mapping will
        also return objects of this type by their game ids.
    PLAYER_STATA : tuple
        English messages corresponding to numeric status values
        in `playerStata`.
    LOCALIZED_PLAYER_STATA : tuple
        Deferred localized messages corresponding to numeric status values
        in `playerStata`.
    PLAYER_STATA_CODES : collections.Mapping
        An immutable mapping of english messages to numeric
        status values.

        Create a random token to be assigned to a new player.
    modifyToken(token)
        Modify a random token to avoid clashing with existing tokens.

        Submit action string and arguments that represent 
        a player's move as a message to the game model.

        This method translates a player's action requested by
        the front end and attempts to submit it to the model's
        message queue for processing.

        This method does not return a value. If there is a
        problem with message submission, it raises an exception.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action : str
            The action string that describes this move on the
            front end.
        args : object, optional
            Python object (e.g. a collection) that contains the
            action's arguments, such as cards played. 
    
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the action string is inappropriate,
            not allowed for the player, or the arguments do not match
            the action.
        RuntimeError
            If this player's game object does not accept messages.
