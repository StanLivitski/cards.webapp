import netifaces

class InboundAddressEnumerator(collections.Sequence):
    """
    Contains list of names and addresses that can be used
    to connect to this host by other network devices and provides
    some additional network address information. 
    
    This class follows the singleton pattern, which means you don't
    create any instances thereof. This module will create the only 
    object of this class and store it in the `FACILITY` class variable.
    Use that instance to determine this host's external names and
    addresses on the network. The results are represented as a
    read-only sequence of ``(label, family, address)`` tuples,
    where:
    
    - ``label`` is the human-readable label of the item
    - ``family`` is either an ``AF_*`` constant from the
      `socket` module if the item contains an address, or
      ``None`` if the item contains a network name
    - ``address`` is either a network name or an address
      in its family-specific string format

    The `FACILITY` sequence is guaranteed to have at least one element:
    this host's name returned by `socket.gethostname`(). If
    `socket.fqdn`() reports a different value, it will be added
    to the sequence as well.

    Additionally, this class has static methods that provide
    network address information. Those methods are summarized
    below.

    Methods
    ---------------
    resolve(nameOrAddress, type_):
        Resolve a host name into network addresses(es) or convert
        addresses(es) to the canonical format
    isLoopbackAddress(family, address, strict):
        Tell whether a network address belongs to a loopback device.

    Raises
    ----------
    RuntimeError
        When an attempt is made to create an additional instance of this
        type.

    Notes
    ----------
    This class uses the `netifaces <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces/>`
    library to determine the host's external addresses in a way that works
    across platforms. ``netifaces`` does not declare the native symbols it
    exports in the Python code, which causes ``Undefined variable from import``
    warnings in the code below. These warnings may be ignored until
    ``netifaces`` is fixed to declare its sybmols properly.

    Examples
    ----------------
    >>> enum = InboundAddressEnumerator.FACILITY
    >>> len(enum) > 0
    True
    >>> all( type(a) is tuple for a in enum )
    True
    >>> all( len(a) == 3 for a in enum )

        ----------
        nameOrAddress : str, optional
            A host name or string address to resolve or convert.
            The default of ``None`` causes this method to obtain
            loopback addresses(es) of this host.

        ------
        tuple

        type_ : int, optional
            Preferred socket type, for example `socket.SOCK_STREAM`
            or `socket.SOCK_DGRAM`. The default value ``0`` means
            that socket addresses of any type can be returned.
