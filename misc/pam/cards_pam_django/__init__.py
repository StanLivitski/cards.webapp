class BaseDjangoAuthenticator(Authenticator):
    """
    Authenticator that delegates to Django user authentication system.

    This authenticator works synchronously, but invokes the callback
    if one is provided. It does not accept arguments when constructed.

        Perform the authentication process.

        When called more than once, this method ignores the new request
        and other arguments, but notifies the new callback, if provided,
        and returns the status of prior authentication.
   
        Parameters
        ----------
        request : django.http.HttpRequest | NoneType
                Authentication request from a user, ignored
                on subsequent calls.
        callback_ : callable, optional
                The function or object to be notified of the
                authentication result. The two arguments that will be
                passed to the callback are the Django user record,
                or a boolean signaling authentication success, and the
                ``True`` on failure or ``None`` if the authentication
                succeeds.
    
        Other parameters
        ----------
        *args : tuple
            Ignored.
        **kwargs : dict
            Ignored.
   
        Returns
        -------
        django.contrib.auth.models.User | bool
            Django user record on success, or ``False`` on failure.
    
        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the required arguments have an inappropriate type.

        Notes
        -----
        Returned user object may or may not have been authenticated
        by Django. In the latter case it will be an ``AnonymousUser``
        instance with ``is_authenticated`` property equal to ``False``.
